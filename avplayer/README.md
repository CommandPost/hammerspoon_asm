hs._asm.avplayer
================

Provides an AudioVisual player For Hammerspoon.

Playback of remote or streaming content has not been thoroughly tested; it's not something I do very often.  However, it has been tested against http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbop/bipbopall.m3u8, which is a sample URL provided in the Apple documentation at https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/AVFoundationPG/Articles/02_Playback.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010188-CH3-SW4


A precompiled version of this module can be found in this directory with a name along the lines of `avplayer-v0.x.tar.gz`. This can be installed by downloading the file and then expanding it as follows:

~~~sh
$ cd ~/.hammerspoon # or wherever your Hammerspoon init.lua file is located
$ tar -xzf ~/Downloads/avplayer-v0.x.tar.gz # or wherever your downloads are located
~~~

If you wish to build this module yourself, and have XCode installed on your Mac, the best way (you are welcome to clone the entire repository if you like, but no promises on the current state of anything else) is to download `init.lua`, `internal.m`, and `Makefile` (at present, nothing else is required) into a directory of your choice and then do the following:

~~~sh
$ cd wherever-you-downloaded-the-files
$ [HS_APPLICATION=/Applications] [PREFIX=~/.hammerspoon] make docs install
~~~

If your Hammerspoon application is located in `/Applications`, you can leave out the `HS_APPLICATION` environment variable, and if your Hammerspoon files are located in their default location, you can leave out the `PREFIX` environment variable.  For most people it will be sufficient to just type `make docs install`.

As always, whichever method you chose, if you are updating from an earlier version it is recommended to fully quit and restart Hammerspoon after installing this module to ensure that the latest version of the module is loaded into memory.

### Usage

 * a live stream may not provide duration information and also return `nan` for this method.

 * Lua defines `nan` as a number which is not equal to itself.  To test if the value of this method is `nan` requires code like the following:
 ~~~lua
 duration = avplayer:duration()
 if type(duration) == "number" and duration ~= duration then
     -- the duration is equal to `nan`
 end

Enable or disable a callback whenever playback of the current media content is completed (reaches the end).

Parameters:
 * `state` - an optional boolean, default false, specifying whether or not completing the playback of media should invoke a callback.

Returns:
 * if an argument is provided, the avplayerObject; otherwise the current value.

Notes:
 * the callback function (see [hs._asm.avplayer:setCallback](#setCallback)) will be invoked with the following 2 arguments:
   * the avplayerObject
   * "finished"

<a name="trackProgress"></a>
~~~lua
avplayer:trackProgress([number | nil]) -> avplayerObject | current value
~~~
Enable or disable a periodic callback at the interval specified.

Parameters:
 * `number` - an optional number specifying how often, in seconds, the callback function should be invoked to report progress.  If an explicit nil is specified, then the progress callback is disabled. Defaults to nil.

Returns:
 * if an argument is provided, the avplayerObject; otherwise the current value.  A return value of `nil` indicates that no progress callback is in effect.

Notes:
 * the callback function (see [hs._asm.avplayer:setCallback](#setCallback)) will be invoked with the following 3 arguments:
   * the avplayerObject
   * "progress"
   * the time in seconds specifying the current location in the media playback.

 * From Apple Documentation: The block is invoked periodically at the interval specified, interpreted according to the timeline of the current item. The block is also invoked whenever time jumps and whenever playback starts or stops. If the interval corresponds to a very short interval in real time, the player may invoke the block less frequently than requested. Even so, the player will invoke the block sufficiently often for the client to update indications of the current time appropriately in its end-user interface.

<a name="trackRate"></a>
~~~lua
avplayer:trackRate([state]) -> avplayerObject | current value
~~~
Enable or disable a callback whenever the rate of playback changes.

Parameters:
 * `state` - an optional boolean, default false, specifying whether or not playback rate changes should invoke a callback.

Returns:
 * if an argument is provided, the avplayerObject; otherwise the current value.

Notes:
 * the callback function (see [hs._asm.avplayer:setCallback](#setCallback)) will be invoked with the following 3 arguments:
   * the avplayerObject
   * "pause", if the rate changes to 0.0, or "play" if the rate changes to any other value
   * the rate that the playback was changed to.

 * Not all media content can have its playback rate changed; attempts to do so will invoke the callback twice -- once signifying that the change was made, and a second time indicating that the rate of play was reset back to the limits of the media content.  See [hs._asm:rate](#rate) for more information.

<a name="trackStatus"></a>
~~~lua
avplayer:trackStatus([state]) -> avplayerObject | current value
~~~
Enable or disable a callback whenever the status of loading a media item changes.

Parameters:
 * `state` - an optional boolean, default false, specifying whether or not changes to the status of audiovisual media's loading status should generate a callback..

Returns:
 * if an argument is provided, the avplayerObject; otherwise the current value.

Notes:
 * the callback function (see [hs._asm.avplayer:setCallback](#setCallback)) will be invoked with the following 3 or 4 arguments:
   * the avplayerObject
   * "status"
   * a string matching one of the states described in [hs._asm.avplayer:status](#status)
   * if the state reported is failed, an error message describing the error that occurred.

<a name="volume"></a>
~~~lua
avplayer:volume([volume]) -> avplayerObject | current value
~~~
Get or set the avplayer object's volume on a linear scale from 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (full volume, relative to the current OS volume).

Parameters:
 * `volume` - an optional number, default as specified by the media or 1.0 if no designation is specified by the media, specifying the player's volume relative to the system volume level.

Returns:
 * if an argument is provided, the avplayerObject; otherwise the current value.

<a name="windowCallback"></a>
~~~lua
avplayer:windowCallback(fn) -> avplayerObject
~~~
Set or clear a callback for updates to the avplayer window

Parameters:
 * `fn` - the function to be called when the avplayer window is moved or closed. Specify an explicit nil to clear the current callback.  The function should expect 2 or 3 arguments and return none.  The arguments will be one of the following:

   * "closing", avplayer - specifies that the avplayer window is being closed, either by the user or with the [hs._asm.avplayer:delete](#delete) method.
     * `action`   - in this case "closing", specifying that the avplayer window is being closed
     * `avplayer` - the avplayer that is being closed

   * "focusChange", avplayer, state - indicates that the avplayer window has either become or stopped being the focused window
     * `action`   - in this case "focusChange", specifying that the avplayer window is being closed
     * `avplayer` - the avplayer that is being closed
     * `state`    - a boolean, true if the avplayer has become the focused window, or false if it has lost focus

   * "frameChange", avplayer, frame - indicates that the avplayer window has been moved or resized
     * `action`   - in this case "focusChange", specifying that the avplayer window is being closed
     * `avplayer` - the avplayer that is being closed
     * `frame`    - a rect-table containing the new co-ordinates and size of the avplayer window

Returns:
 * The avplayer object

<a name="windowStyle"></a>
~~~lua
avplayer:windowStyle(mask) -> avplayerObject | currentMask
~~~
Get or set the window display style

Parameters:
 * mask - if present, this mask should be a combination of values found in `hs.webview.windowMasks` describing the window style.  The mask should be provided as one of the following:
   * integer - a number representing the style which can be created by combining values found in `hs.webview.windowMasks` with the logical or operator.
   * string  - a single key from `hs.webview.windowMasks` which will be toggled in the current window style.
   * table   - a list of keys from `hs.webview.windowMasks` which will be combined to make the final style by combining their values with the logical or operator.

Returns:
 * if a mask is provided, then the avplayerObject is returned; otherwise the current mask value is returned.
