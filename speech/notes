Notes about the property methods - what works, what doesn't.  Hopefully this will lead to wrapped functions/methods in the
final module that are safe enough for usage in core.

status - read
{
  NumberOfCharactersLeft = 0, -- MacinTalk: number of characters remaining to be spoken, isn't reset to 0 after final word.
  OutputBusy = 0,             -- synthesizer is currently outputting something
  OutputPaused = 1,           -- synthesizer is currently paused
  PhonemeCode = 0             -- Macintalk: phoneme code being spoken
}

recentSync - read
  most recently seen sync number

phonemeSymbols - read
  Macintalk - table of phoneme definitions, otherwise nil

characterMode, numberMode - read/write
  Macintalk, works as expected
  Modern, get always shows NORM, but set either and everything (letters and numbers) are spoken individually

inputMode - read/write
  Macintalk, works as expected
  Modern, can read, but can't set to PHON

rate, pitchBase, pitchMod, volume - read/write
  More or less work as expected, but I can't tell the difference with pitchMod in modern voices

currentVoice - write
  error if current voice is a modern one
  can change to a macintalk voice if currently a macintalkvoice, but doesn't change results of :voice() method

commandDelimiter - write
  works as expected

reset - write
  works as expected, use nil as value - note, does not reset commandDelimiters, though

outputToFileURL - write
  works? creates file, but it was empty... I'm not sure when it needs to be created... during actual speech?


** add wrappers and hide direct property access... leave commented out for the curious or future fixes:

*     isSpeaking
*     add isPaused
*     add phonemeSymbolDictionary
*       Phoneme in callback -- can be looked up now via :poneticSymbols()
*     pitchBase and pitchMod
*     reset
*     fix documentation that refers to property methods
*     Figure out what to do re sync in callback

-     look at addSpeechDictionary... worth it? No. Not until its asked for.

# Can be done via embedded commands, so not unless someone asks or provides code.
#     characterMode (numberMode?) toggle, but set field for query
#     inputMode toggle, but set field for query
#     commandDelimeter - set field for query

      document basic embedded commands
      add URLs for Carbon and Cocoa API for the curious
