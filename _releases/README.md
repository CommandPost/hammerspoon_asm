### Module Releases

This folder contains precompiled/prepackaged releases for some of the Hammerspoon modules in this repository.  As always, you can build the most recent yourself following instructions found in the repository's sub-directory.

Any module downloaded from this folder may be installed by expanding it in your `~/.hammerspoon/` directory (or any other directory in your `package.path` and `package.cpath` search paths):

~~~bash
cd ~/.hammerspoon
tar -xzf ~/Downloads/module-vX.Y.tar.gz # or wherever your downloads are saved
~~~
