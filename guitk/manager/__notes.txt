Notes re what the manager needs to be able to do:

    add table containing manager properties for each element
        minimumSize = { h =, w = } - if not set, use fittingSize where provided
        center = { x =, y = }      - allow percentages like canvas
        others?

    insert element - to specify order of selectable controls

    need a way to adjust frame where missing elements don't change
                                     missing elements are set to fitting/minimum

    need a way to add in specific direction from a given element (currently defaults to underneath)
