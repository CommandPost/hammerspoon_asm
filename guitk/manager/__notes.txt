// add fittingSize to canvas
//   modify canvas methods that disable themselves when canvas not in hs.canvas window? can they be made to work here/touchbar as well?

mgr[#] = {
    _element = hs.asm.guitk.element.type.new...(...), -- required else error

mgr[#] = nil -- removes, # must be [1, #mgr]

mgr[#] --> returns table, allows properties to be modified; properties with _ prefix are read-only
mgr(#) === mgr[#]._element --> the element userdata
