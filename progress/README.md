hs._asm.progress
================

This module provides access to progress indicators used by the operating system to show progress and when an application is busy.


This is still a work in progress, but is stable.  Documentation and installation instructions will be updated in the near future.

### Installation

Compiled versions of this module can be found in the _`releases` folder at the top-level of this repository.  You can download the release and install it by expanding it in your `~/.hammerspoon/` directory (or any other directory in your `package.path` and `package.cpath` search paths):

~~~bash
cd ~/.hammerspoon
tar -xzf ~/Downloads/progress-vX.Y.tar.gz # or wherever your downloads are saved
~~~

If this doesn't work for you, or you want to build the latest and greatest, follow the directions below:

This does require that you have XCode or the XCode Command Line Tools installed.  See the App Store application or https://developer.apple.com to install these if necessary.

~~~bash
$ git clone https://github.com/asmagill/hammerspoon_asm
$ cd hammerspoon_asm/progress
$ [HS_APPLICATION=/Applications] [PREFIX=~/.hammerspoon] make install
~~~

If Hammerspoon.app is in your /Applications folder, you may leave `HS_APPLICATION=/Applications` out and if you are fine with the module being installed in your Hammerspoon configuration directory, you may leave `PREFIX=~/.hammerspoon` out as well.  For most people, it will probably be sufficient to just type `make install`.

In either case, if you are upgrading over a previous installation of this module, you must completely quit and restart Hammerspoon before the new version will be fully recognized.

### Usage
~~~lua
progress = require("hs._asm.progress")
~~~

### Module Functions

~~~lua
progress.new(rect) -> progressObject
~~~
Create a new progress indicator object at the specified location and size.

Parameters:
 * rect - a table containing the rectangular coordinates of the progress indicator and its background.

Returns:
 * a progress indicator object

Notes:
 * Depending upon the type and size of the indicator, the actual indicator's size varies.  As of 10.11, the observed sizes are:
   * circular - between 10 and 32 for width and height, depending upon size
   * bar      - between 12 and 20 for height, depending upon size.
 * The rectangle defined in this function reflects a rectangle in which the indicator is centered.  This is to facilitate drawing an opaque or semi-transparent "shade" over content, if desired, while performing some task for which the indicator is being used to indicate activity.  This shade is set to a light grey semi-transparent color (defined in `hs.drawing.color` as { white = 0.75, alpha = 0.75 }).

### Module Methods

~~~lua
progress:backgroundColor([color]) -> progressObject
~~~
Get or set the color of the progress indicator's background.

Parameters:
 * color - an optional table specifying a color as defined in `hs.drawing.color` for the progress indicator's background.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:bezeled([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set whether or not the progress indicatorâ€™s frame has a three-dimensional bezel.

Parameters:
 * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the indicator's frame is bezeled.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default setting for this is true.
 * In my testing, this setting does not seem to have much, if any, effect on the visual aspect of the indicator and is provided in this module in case this changes in a future OS X update (there are some indications that it may have had an effect in previous versions).

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:delete() -> none
~~~
Close and remove a progress indicator.

Parameters:
 * None

Returns:
 * None

Notes:
 * This method is called automatically during garbage collection (most notably, when Hammerspoon is exited or the Hammerspoon configuration is reloaded).

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:circular([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set whether or not the progress indicator is circular or a in the form of a progress bar.

Parameters:
 * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the indicator is circular (true) or a progress bar (false)

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default setting for this is false.
 * An indeterminate circular indicator is displayed as the spinning star seen during system startup.
 * A determinate circular indicator is displayed as a pie chart which fills up as its value increases.
 * An indeterminate progress indicator is displayed as a rounded rectangle with a moving pulse.
 * A determinate progress indicator is displayed as a rounded rectangle that fills up as its value increases.

~~~lua
progress:displayWhenStopped([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set whether or not the progress indicator is visible when animation has been stopped.

Parameters:
 * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the progress indicator is visible when animation has stopped.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default setting for this is true.
 * The background is not hidden by this method when animation is not running, only the indicator itself.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:frame([rect]) -> progressObject
~~~
Get or set the frame of the the progress indicator and its background.

Parameters:
 * rect - an optional table containing the rectangular coordinates of the progress indicator and its background.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:hide() -> progressObject
~~~
Hides the progress indicator and its background.

Parameters:
 * None

Returns:
 * the progress indicator object

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:indeterminate([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set whether or not the progress indicator is indeterminate.  A determinate indicator displays how much of the task has been completed. An indeterminate indicator shows simply that the application is busy.

Parameters:
 * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the indicator is indeterminate.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default setting for this is true.
 * If this setting is set to false, you should also take a look at [hs._asm.progress:min](#min) and [hs._asm.progress:max](#max), and periodically update the status with [hs._asm.progress:value](#value) or [hs._asm.progress:increment](#increment)

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:increment(value) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Increment the current value of a progress indicator's progress by the amount specified.

Parameters:
 * value - the value by which to increment the progress indicator's current value.

Returns:
 * the progress indicator object

Notes:
 * Programmatically, this is equivalent to `hs._asm.progress:value(hs._asm.progress:value() + value)`, but is faster.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:indicatorSize([size]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set the indicator's size.

Parameters:
 * size - an optional integer matching one of the values in [hs._asm.progress.controlSize](#controlSize), which indicates the desired size of the indicator.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default setting for this is 0, which corresponds to `hs._asm.progress.controlSize.regular`.
 * For circular indicators, the sizes seem to be 32x32, 16x16, and 10x10 in 10.11.
 * For bar indicators, the height seems to be 20 and 12; the mini size seems to be ignored, at least in 10.11.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:level([level]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set the window level of the progress indicator.

Parameters:
 * level - an optional integer representing the window level, as defined in `hs.drawing.windowLevels`, you wish the progress indicator to be moved to.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * the default level is defined as `hs.drawing.windowLevels.screenSaver`

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:max([value]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set the maximum value (the value at which the progress indicator should display as full) for the progress indicator.

Parameters:
 * value - an optional number indicating the maximum value.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default value for this is 100.0
 * This value has no effect on the display of an indeterminate progress indicator.
 * For a determinate indicator, the behavior is undefined if this value is less than [hs._asm.progress:min](#min).

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:min([value]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set the minimum value (the value at which the progress indicator should display as empty) for the progress indicator.

Parameters:
 * value - an optional number indicating the minimum value.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default value for this is 0.0
 * This value has no effect on the display of an indeterminate progress indicator.
 * For a determinate indicator, the behavior is undefined if this value is greater than [hs._asm.progress:max](#max).

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:setFillColor(color) -> progressObject
~~~
Sets the fill color for a progress indicator.

Parameters:
 * color - a table specifying a color as defined in `hs.drawing.color` indicating the color to use for the progress indicator.

Returns:
 * the progress indicator object

Notes:
 * This method is not based upon the methods inherent in the NSProgressIndicator Objective-C class, but rather on code found at http://stackoverflow.com/a/32396595 utilizing a CIFilter object to adjust the view's output.
 * For circular and determinate bar progress indicators, this method works as expected.
 * For indeterminate bar progress indicators, this method will set the entire bar to the color specified and no animation effect is apparent.  Hopefully this is a temporary limitation.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:setSize(size) -> progressObject
~~~
Sets the size of the indicator's background.

Parameters:
 * size - a table containing a keys for h and w, specifying the size of the indicators background.

Returns:
 * the progress indicator object

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:setTopLeft(point) -> progressObject
~~~
Sets the top left point of the progress objects background.

Parameters:
 * point - a table containing a keys for x and y, specifying the top left point to move the indicator and its background to.

Returns:
 * the progress indicator object

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:show() -> progressObject
~~~
Displays the progress indicator and its background.

Parameters:
 * None

Returns:
 * the progress indicator object

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:start() -> progressObject
~~~
If the progress indicator is indeterminate, starts the animation for the indicator.

Parameters:
 * None

Returns:
 * the progress indicator object

Notes:
 * This method has no effect if the indicator is not indeterminate.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:stop() -> progressObject
~~~
If the progress indicator is indeterminate, stops the animation for the indicator.

Parameters:
 * None

Returns:
 * the progress indicator object

Notes:
 * This method has no effect if the indicator is not indeterminate.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:threaded([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set whether or not the animation for an indicator occurs in a separate process thread.

Parameters:
 * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the animation for the indicator should occur in a separate thread.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default setting for this is true.
 * If this flag is set to false, the indicator animation speed will fluctuate as Hammerspoon performs other activities, though not consistently enough to provide a reliable "activity level" feedback indicator.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:tint([tint]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set the indicator's tint.

Parameters:
 * tint - an optional integer matching one of the values in [hs._asm.progress.controlTint](#controlTint), which indicates the tint of the progress indicator.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default setting for this is 0, which corresponds to `hs._asm.progress.controlTint.default`.
 * In my testing, this setting does not seem to have much, if any, effect on the visual aspect of the indicator and is provided in this module in case this changes in a future OS X update (there are some indications that it may have had an effect in previous versions).

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress:value([value]) -> progressObject | current value
~~~
Get or set the current value of the progress indicator's completion status.

Parameters:
 * value - an optional number indicating the current extent of the progress.

Returns:
 * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.

Notes:
 * The default value for this is 0.0
 * This value has no effect on the display of an indeterminate progress indicator.
 * For a determinate indicator, this will affect how "filled" the bar or circle is.  If the value is lower than [hs._asm.progress:min](#min), then it will be reset to that value.  If the value is greater than [hs._asm.progress:max](#max), then it will be reset to that value.

### Module Constants

~~~lua
progress.controlSize[]
~~~
A table containing key-value pairs defining recognized sizes which can be used with the [hs._asm.progress:indicatorSize](#indicatorSize) method.

Contents:
 * regular - display the indicator at its regular size
 * small   - display a smaller version of the indicator
 * mini    - for circular indicators, display an even smaller version; for bar indicators, this setting has no effect.

_ _ _

~~~lua
progress.controlTint[]
~~~
A table containing key-value pairs defining recognized tints which can be used with the [hs._asm.progress:tint](#tint) method.

Contents:
 * default
 * blue
 * graphite
 * clear

Notes:
 * In my testing, setting `hs._asm.progress:tint` does not seem to have much, if any, effect on the visual aspect of an indicator and this table is provided in this module in case this changes in a future OS X update (there are some indications that it may have had an effect in previous versions).
