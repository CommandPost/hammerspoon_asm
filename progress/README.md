hs._asm.progress
================

This module provides access to progress indicators used by the operating system to show progress and when an application is busy.


This is still a work in progress, but is stable.  Documentation and installation instructions will be updated in the near future.



#pragma mark - Module Functions

/// hs._asm.progress.new(rect) -> progressObject
/// Constructor
/// Create a new progress indicator object at the specified location and size.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * rect - a table containing the rectangular coordinates of the progress indicator and its background.
///
/// Returns:
///  * a progress indicator object
///
/// Notes:
///  * Depending upon the type and size of the indicator, the actual indicator's size varies.  As of 10.11, the observed sizes are:
///    * circular - between 10 and 32 for width and height, depending upon size
///    * bar      - between 12 and 20 for height, depending upon size.
///  * The rectangle defined in this function reflects a rectangle in which the indicator is centered.  This is to facilitate drawing an opaque or semi-transparent "shade" over content, if desired, while performing some task for which the indicator is being used to indicate activity.  This shade is set to a light grey semi-transparent color (defined in `hs.drawing.color` as { white = 0.75, alpha = 0.75 }).

/// If the progress indicator is indeterminate, starts the animation for the indicator.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * None
///
/// Returns:
///  * the progress indicator object
///
/// Notes:
///  * This method has no effect if the indicator is not indeterminate.



/// hs._asm.progress:stop() -> progressObject
/// Method
/// If the progress indicator is indeterminate, stops the animation for the indicator.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * None
///
/// Returns:

///  * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the animation for the indicator should occur in a separate thread.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default setting for this is true.
///  * If this flag is set to false, the indicator animation speed will fluctuate as Hammerspoon performs other activities, though not consistently enough to provide a reliable "activity level" feedback indicator.



/// hs._asm.progress:indeterminate([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set whether or not the progress indicator is indeterminate.  A determinate indicator displays how much of the task has been completed. An indeterminate indicator shows simply that the application is busy.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the indicator is indeterminate.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default setting for this is true.
///  * If this setting is set to false, you should also take a look at [hs._asm.progress:min](#min) and [hs._asm.progress:max](#max), and periodically update the status with [hs._asm.progress:value](#value) or [hs._asm.progress:increment](#increment)



/// hs._asm.progress:bezeled([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set whether or not the progress indicatorâ€™s frame has a three-dimensional bezel.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the indicator's frame is bezeled.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default setting for this is true.
///  * In my testing, this setting does not seem to have much, if any, effect on the visual aspect of the indicator and is provided in this module in case this changes in a future OS X update (there are some indications that it may have had an effect in previous versions).



/// hs._asm.progress:displayWhenStopped([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set whether or not the progress indicator is visible when animation has been stopped.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the progress indicator is visible when animation has stopped.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default setting for this is true.
///  * The background is not hidden by this method when animation is not running, only the indicator itself.



/// hs._asm.progress:circular([flag]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set whether or not the progress indicator is circular or a in the form of a progress bar.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * flag - an optional boolean indicating whether or not the indicator is circular (true) or a progress bar (false)
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default setting for this is false.
///  * An indeterminate circular indicator is displayed as the spinning star seen during system startup.
///  * A determinate circular indicator is displayed as a pie chart which fills up as its value increases.
///  * An indeterminate progress indicator is displayed as a rounded rectangle with a moving pulse.
///  * A determinate progress indicator is displayed as a rounded rectangle that fills up as its value increases.



/// hs._asm.progress:value([value]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set the current value of the progress indicator's completion status.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * value - an optional number indicating the current extent of the progress.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default value for this is 0.0
///  * This value has no effect on the display of an indeterminate progress indicator.
///  * For a determinate indicator, this will affect how "filled" the bar or circle is.  If the value is lower than [hs._asm.progress:min](#min), then it will be reset to that value.  If the value is greater than [hs._asm.progress:max](#max), then it will be reset to that value.



/// hs._asm.progress:min([value]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set the minimum value (the value at which the progress indicator should display as empty) for the progress indicator.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * value - an optional number indicating the minimum value.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:

///  * This value has no effect on the display of an indeterminate progress indicator.
///  * For a determinate indicator, the behavior is undefined if this value is greater than [hs._asm.progress:max](#max).



/// hs._asm.progress:max([value]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set the maximum value (the value at which the progress indicator should display as full) for the progress indicator.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * value - an optional number indicating the maximum value.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default value for this is 100.0
///  * This value has no effect on the display of an indeterminate progress indicator.

/// hs._asm.progress:increment(value) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Increment the current value of a progress indicator's progress by the amount specified.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * value - the value by which to increment the progress indicator's current value.
///
/// Returns:
///  * the progress indicator object
///
/// Notes:
///  * Programmatically, this is equivalent to `hs._asm.progress:value(hs._asm.progress:value() + value)`, but is faster.



/// hs._asm.progress:tint([tint]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set the indicator's size/
///
/// Parameters:
///  * tint - an optional integer matching one of the values in [hs._asm.progress.controlTint](#controlTint), which indicates the tint of the progress indicator.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default setting for this is 0, which corresponds to `hs._asm.progress.controlTint.default`.
///  * In my testing, this setting does not seem to have much, if any, effect on the visual aspect of the indicator and is provided in this module in case this changes in a future OS X update (there are some indications that it may have had an effect in previous versions).



/// hs._asm.progress:indicatorSize([size]) -> progressObject | current value
/// Method
/// Get or set the indicator's size/
///
/// Parameters:
///  * size - an optional integer matching one of the values in [hs._asm.progress.controlSize](#controlSize), which indicates the desired size of the indicator.
///
/// Returns:
///  * if a value is provided, returns the progress indicator object ; otherwise returns the current value.
///
/// Notes:
///  * The default setting for this is 0, which corresponds to `hs._asm.progress.controlSize.regular`.
///  * For circular indicators, the sizes seem to be 32x32, 16x16, and 10x10 in 10.11.
///  * For bar indicators, the height seems to be 20 and 12; the mini size seems to be ignored, at least in 10.11.



/// hs._asm.progress:setTopLeft(point) -> progressObject
/// Method
/// Sets the top left point of the progress objects background.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * point - a table containing a keys for x and y, specifying the top left point to move the indicator and its background to.
///
/// Returns:
///  * the progress indicator object



/// hs._asm.progress:setSize(size) -> progressObject
/// Method
/// Sets the size of the indicator's background.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * size - a table containing a keys for h and w, specifying the size of the indicators background.
///
/// Returns:
///  * the progress indicator object



/// hs._asm.progress:frame([rect]) -> progressObject
/// Method
/// Get or set the frame of the the progress indicator and its background.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * rect - an optional table containing the rectangular coordinates of the progress indicator and its background.

///  * color - a table specifying a color as defined in `hs.drawing.color` indicating the color to use for the progress indicator.
///
/// Returns:
///  * the progress indicator object
///
/// Notes:
///  * This method is not based upon the methods inherent in the NSProgressIndicator Objective-C class, but rather on code found at http://stackoverflow.com/a/32396595 utilizing a CIFilter object to adjust the view's output.
///  * For circular and determinate bar progress indicators, this method works as expected.
///  * For indeterminate bar progress indicators, this method will set the entire bar to the color specified and no animation effect is apparent.  Hopefully this is a temporary limitation.



/// hs._asm.progress:backgroundColor([color]) -> progressObject
/// Method
/// Get or set the color of the progress indicator's background.
///
/// Parameters:
///  * color - an optional table specifying a color as defined in `hs.drawing.color` for the progress indicator's background.
