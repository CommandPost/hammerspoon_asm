    text/image affect clipping region?
    text/image target actual rendered area instead of frame?

    NSGraphicsContext imageInterpolation?

    remove circle and arc?
    merge canvases?
    method to swap elements?

canvas as element type
    a view can have only one window... we need to change to store view itself and not canvas object (window)
    we still want access to originating window, though, so changes, etc. can be made to it and it can be put back so normal __gc can occur
