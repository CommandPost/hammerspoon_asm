~   text(??)/image(yes) mouseEvents for actual rendered area instead of frame?
    text/image affect clipping region? would require converting text to glyphs... worth the trouble?

    test callback/mousetracking in canvas containing canvas
    canvas containing canvas containing canvas?

    recheck methods for proper action when canvas is subview
    document differences when canvas is a subview

    can we get rid of selfref?  I don't think so if we want to allow drawings to persist without lua objects.
        can we tie it to something else?
