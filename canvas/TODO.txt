+   merge canvases? sorta -- can now use a canvas as an element
    method to duplicate canvas?  Only canvas elements would have to handled special, since other "object" types support copying

    remove circle and arc (variants of oval and ellipticalArc)?  or method to convert between them?

    text/image affect clipping region? would require converting text to glyphs... worth the trouble?
    text/image target actual rendered area instead of frame?

    NSGraphicsContext imageInterpolation?
