+   merge canvases? sorta -- can now use a canvas as an element
      check mouse tracking wrt to canvas as element... what happens if enabled with its own callback within the sub-canvas?

-   method to duplicate canvas?  Only canvas elements would have to handled special, since other "object" types support copying

.   hs.drawing replacement wrapper

*   add boolean for bounds versus rendered content for mouse tracking?

+   text(??)/image(yes) mouseEvents for actual rendered area instead of frame?
    text/image affect clipping region? would require converting text to glyphs... worth the trouble?
