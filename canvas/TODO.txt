      check mouse tracking wrt to canvas as element... what happens if enabled with its own callback within the sub-canvas?

    method to duplicate canvas?  Only canvas elements would have to handled special, since other "object" types support copying

    remove circle and arc (variants of oval and ellipticalArc)?  or method to convert between them?

+   text(??)/image(yes) mouseEvents for actual rendered area instead of frame?
