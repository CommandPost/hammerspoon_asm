~   text(??)/image(yes) mouseEvents for actual rendered area instead of frame?
    text/image affect clipping region? would require converting text to glyphs... worth the trouble?

+   change `canvas` type to `view` type
~   hs._asm.canvas.avplayer
        can we gracefully handle fullscreen toggle, or should this be removed/made possible outside of canvas?
        rethink using notificationcenter for playing ended tracker
        move status tracker to playerItem... will have to adjust load to disable/re-enable KVO... canvasDidAdd as well

    document how to write external type as NSView subclass, with AVPlayerView as example

    test callback/mousetracking in canvas containing canvas
    canvas containing canvas containing canvas?

    recheck methods for proper action when canvas is subview
    document differences when canvas is a subview

+   removeElement, assingElement, __gc need to check for "removeFromSuperview" for elements

    can we get rid of selfref?  I don't think so if we want to allow drawings to persist without lua objects.
        can we tie it to something else?
