This will most likely be added to the Hammerspoon code modules sometime, but I'm not positive it will be fully documented or tested before 0.9.47 is released... staging here for the moment in case anyone wants to take a look at it.  The Makefile will install this as `hs.network.ping`, but since it's not actually part of core yet, the Hammerspoon autoload feature won't be able to find it -- you will have to load it as `ping = require("hs.network.ping").
